## P1

Summary: Load the data from the file 7.R.RData, and plot it using plot(x,y). What is the slope coefficient in a linear regression of y on x (to within 10%)?


Task 1: Load the data from the file 7.R.RData

```{r}
load("7.R.RData")
```


Task 2: Plot the data.

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```


Task 3: Return slope coefficient in a linear regression of y on x (to within 10%).

```{r}
fita = lm(y~ x)
out <- summary(fita)
out$coefficients[2, 1]
```


## P2

Summary: For the model y ~ 1+x+x^2, what is the coefficient of x (to within 10%)?

Task 1: Return slope coefficient of x (to within 10%).

```{r}
fitb = lm(y~ 1+x+I(x^2))
out2 <- summary(fitb)
out2$coefficients[2, 1]
```
